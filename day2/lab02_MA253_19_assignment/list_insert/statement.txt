Implement push_back() and pop_back() for circular doubly linked list.
The push_front() and pop_front() are already implemented.
You may get an idea from that code.

Modify only the following file: list_pushpop.cpp
DO NOT modify the following filesr: main.cpp,list.h,list_other.cpp
Compile using commandline: g++ -o list main.cpp list_other.cpp list_pushpop.cpp
Test your program using: ./list < inputn  (where n = 1,2,3 etc.)
output must mach the corresponding "outputn" (for n = 1,2,3 etc.)
